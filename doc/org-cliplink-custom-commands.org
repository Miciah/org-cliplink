* Custom Commands
  It is possible to create your own ~org-cliplink~-like commands with
  the ~org-cliplink-retrieve-title~ function. For example:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (org-cliplink-retrieve-title
     "https://google.com/"
     `(lambda (url title)
        (if title
            (message "%s has title %s" url title)
          (message "%s doesn't have title" url))))
  #+END_SRC

  I use it for making org-mode tasks from URLs. Here is some code from
  my Emacs config:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (defun rc/cliplink-task ()
      (interactive)
      (org-cliplink-retrieve-title
       (substring-no-properties (current-kill 0))
       '(lambda (url title)
          (insert (concat "* TODO " title
                          "\n  [[" url "][" title "]]")))))

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x p t") 'rc/cliplink-task)
  #+END_SRC

  So when I browse the Web and see an interesting article that I want
  to read later I just copy its URL to the clipboard, switch to my
  org-mode files with personal notes and hit ~C-x p t~.

  For more information see ~C-h f org-cliplink-retrieve-title RET~.
